ELMS ICMS Alpha 5 is built on top of the Pressflow Distribution.  Pressflow is a performance optimized version of Drupal CMS.  It is very close to production ready.  The features of this system are starting to be fully ironed out as discussions progress.  Modules and Libraries used as part of this distribution are licensed according to their local LICENSE / README files.  If you are interested in joining efforts in development please email elms@psu.edu.

------------
INSTALLATION
------------
*Download the ELMS ICMS Alpha 5 distribution from http://drupal.psu.edu/fserver
*Unzip and go to the install.php page from a web-browser as you normally would when installing Drupal
*Select ELMS ICMS radio bubble and run through the typical Drupal installation
*You are now running ELMS ICMS Alpha 5, enjoy making courses!
*Make sure you reset your user account as an initial one has been created for you (admin/random password)

------------
Known issues
------------
*Link Checker and HTML Export aren't fully implemented
*There is no way of importing content from previous versions of ELMS / Drupal running courses (yet)
*There are certain admin pages where Batch Jobs (Drupal displays the progress bar to do something) will throw an error. This is still being investigated
