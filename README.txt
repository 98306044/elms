ELMS ICMS Alpha 5 is built on top of the Pressflow Distribution.  Pressflow is a performance optimized version of Drupal CMS.  It is very close to production ready as Alpha 5 should be the last release that will be marked Alpha.  The features of this system are still being ironed out as discussions progress.  Modules and Libraries used as part of this distribution are licensed according to their local LICENSE / README files.  If you are interested in joining efforts in development please email elms@psu.edu.

UPGRADE PATH
------------
If you were running Alpha 4 there is no upgrade path to Alpha 5.  Clear out Alpha 4's files and install this release as a fresh install.  There should be an upgrade path from Alpha 5 to Beta 1 but upgrades won't be formally supported until we are in the Beta phase of releases.

------------
INSTALLATION
------------
*Download the ELMS ICMS Alpha 5 distribution from http://drupal.psu.edu/fserver
*Unzip and go to the install.php page from a web-browser as you normally would when installing Drupal
*Select the ELMS radio bubble and run through the typical Drupal installation
*You are now running ELMS ICMS Alpha 5, enjoy making courses!

------------
Known issues
------------
*There are still some admin UIs that need to be built out and more visual user management
*The Studio, Reactions and Schedule Features have not been fully implemented.  The Course Content feature is mostly feature complete at this time.
* There are settings pages for all features but only the Course Content settings page has been partially implemented.  These should be finished for the next release
